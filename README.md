# AOC2024

**Advent of Code 2024**

Being my first time at AOC, I'm gradually working on my boilerplate. First I started w/ each
part being a test. Run these with the following command (up to day 9).

```
mix test test/dxx_test.exs
```

But then I didn't like that the language server wasn't running on the script files, so at day 10 I switched to just making modules for each day, and running with this command.

```
mix run -e Dxx.run
```

My appologies if anyone finds there way to this code, and the organization is so awful.
